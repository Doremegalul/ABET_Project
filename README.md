# ABET Project Description

This repository contains a series of C++ files, each contributing to a project centered around graph theory and its practical applications:

- swap.h: A header file with utility functions for swapping elements, essential in various algorithms, especially sorting.

- graph.h: This header file is crucial to the repository, defining structures and functions necessary for graph data structures. It features the implementation of the Dijkstra Algorithm, an algorithm for finding the shortest paths in weighted graphs, used in network routing, GPS navigation, and other pathfinding scenarios.

- graphClient.cpp: A C++ source file that acts as a client to test and demonstrate the functionalities provided by graph.h, including the Dijkstra Algorithm.

- minHeap-graph.h: A header file that integrates min-heap data structures with graph theory to optimize the efficiency of graph processing algorithms, such as the Dijkstra Algorithm.

- passArgToMain.cpp: This source file includes a method for parsing and handling command-line arguments in C++. It is a functional component that enhances the flexibility and usability of the application, allowing for dynamic data input and control.

- road.txt and city.txt: Text files containing datasets on roads and cities, used as inputs for graph-based algorithms or simulations, particularly for the Dijkstra Algorithm in graph.h.

This repository provides a comprehensive toolkit for implementing and experimenting with graph-based algorithms in C++, with a strong emphasis on the Dijkstra Algorithm, making it apt for applications in network analysis, pathfinding, and other areas where efficient graph processing is critical.
